- ⚡ Fun fact:
My journey into the world of data began with a humble spreadsheet. Driven by curiosity, I decided to track my daily coffee intake for an entire year (spoiler: 365 cups didn’t quite suffice!).
Analyzing the trends, I discovered that Mondays saw a 30% surge in caffeine consumption compared to other days a clear indicator of my need for an extra boost to start the week.
This small experiment opened my eyes to the incredible stories data can reveal and sparked my passion for uncovering meaningful insights hidden within the numbers, one dataset at a time.
